Hello, my name is Michael Zheng and I'm currently a student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science and Finance (CFM).

I started this github because I wanted to display coding projects I made. I'm especially interested in the field of quantitative finance and so I'm mainly working on building quantitative models that have an impact when measuring equities. I'm also very much interested in data analytics / data science, machine and deep learning, natural language processing, and time series analysis. 

Also, you can find my Linkedin at: www.linkedin.com/in/michaelzheng-

Some ideas for projects that I want to code in the future: Banking system (C programming), Something using Bloomberg API (python), options strategies app w/ real options data (either python or c++),
