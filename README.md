Hello, my name is Michael Zheng and I'm currently a student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science and Finance (CFM) with a Statistics Minor.

I started this github because I wanted to display coding projects I made. I'm especially interested in the fields of software engineering and quantitative finance. I try to focus on creating projects related to finance, along with projects where I explore using new tech to expand my skills.

Currently working on: a micro-saas idea :)
