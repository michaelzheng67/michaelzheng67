Hello, my name is Michael Zheng and I'm currently a student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science and Finance (CFM).

I started this github because I wanted to display coding projects I made. I'm especially interested in the field of quantitative finance and so I'm working on 
building financial models related to the field.
