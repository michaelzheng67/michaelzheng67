Hello, my name is Michael Zheng and I'm currently a student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science and Finance (CFM).

I started this github because I wanted to display coding projects I made. I'm especially interested in the field of quantitative finance and so I'm mainly working on building quantitative models that have impact when measuring equities. I'm also very much interested in data analytics, machine and deep learning, natural language processing, and time series analysis.
